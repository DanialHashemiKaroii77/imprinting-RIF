In silico analysis and experimental validation of imprinting gene in the endometrium of recurrent implantation failure

Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) represent intricate issues within the realm of assisted reproductive technology (ART), and their underlying causes are often linked to compromised endometrial receptivity. Eight microarray datasets related to RIF and RSA were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and were subsequently integrated. To finalize the investigation, hub genes, miRNA, and lncRNA with imprinting significance were pinpointed through the application of CytoHubba. After validation with real-time PCR, the present research used computational methods to find the best DEG inhibitor(s) among FDA-approved drugs. In the endometrial tissue of individuals suffering from RIF and RSA, a noteworthy differential expression was observed in 33 genes, 49 microRNAs, and 137 long non-coding RNAs that are associated with imprinted gene regulation. Through a meticulous functional enrichment analysis, it became evident that the altered gene expression profile in these two patient groups primarily pertained to significant modifications in biological processes. Specifically, these changes were predominantly linked to the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, the regulation of interleukin-1 beta production, and the binding of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate within the endometrial tissue. Furthermore, a subset of key DEGs, including RASGRF1, NTM, and KBTBD3 were identified as hub genes implicated in the pathogenesis of RIF, while KBTBD3, PTPN14, and DHCR7 were singled out as hub genes specifically associated with RSA. The real-time PCR validation shows that RASGRF1, NTM, and KBTBD3 are significantly changed
